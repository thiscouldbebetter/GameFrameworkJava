GameFrameworkJava
=================

The Java code in this repository is planned to eventually implement a menu, profile, display, media, physics, model, and persistence framework around an rudimentary video game.

It is a port of a JavaScript original available at https://github.com/thiscouldbebetter/GameFramework.

Some homemade media files are included in the Content directory for testing purposes.
